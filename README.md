1 CONTEXT: SYMULATION
Consider the following simulation: in a two-dimensional area of n x m (dimensions in meters) move in any direction and at a random speed (no more than 2.5[]) and healthy individuals. The speed and direction of their movement can vary randomly over time (but cannot exceed the upper limit set above). Upon reaching any boundary of the area, each individual may:
turn back inside the area (probability 50 percent) leave the area (probability 50 percent)\
During the course of the simulation, new individuals enter the area at random points on its borders (frequency of entry and initial size and select to maintain population continuity). For each entering individual, there is a probability of virus infection of 10 percent.\
Each individual in the population is:\
-resistant to infection\
or (exclusionary alternative)\
-susceptible to infection\
if an individual is susceptible to infection it is:\
-healthy\
or (exclusionary alternative)\
-infected\
if the individual is infected then:\
-has symptoms\
or (exclusionary alternative)\
-does not have symptoms
